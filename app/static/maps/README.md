# Maps and styles

Since the POLDER Federated Search App is meant to cover all polar research - that is, Arctic and Antarctic data, polar projections of both areas of interest seemed to be the way to go.

For the Arctic map, we wanted to use the [tileset](http://webmap.arcticconnect.ca/tiles.html) from [ArcticConnect](http://arcticconnect.ca), who have been working with us in order to make this app happen. There was no corresponding Antarctic map, so we took the [ArcticConnect styles](https://github.com/GeoSensorWebLab/awm-styles/tree/stable/1.0), applied selected features to a Mapbox-GL style, and exported that to this directory in order to replicate the look and feel of the ArcticConnect map.

If you want to make your own map styles, you can do it in [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/), download the ZIP file that Mapbox provides as an export, and put it in this directory.
