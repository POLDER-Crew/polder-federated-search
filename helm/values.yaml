# It's not normally a great idea to hardcode a service IP address. However, in this case, we have
# a configMap for Gleaner that needs to know where this endpoint is (it's under minio:address in
# setup-gleaner.yaml), and which will only accept an IP address, which means that we can't use the
# service DNS name for this. We could use helm's lookup function for this, EXCEPT that ConfigMaps are
# evaluated before everything else - which means that the service does not have an IP address when
# the ConfigMap is constructed. The workaround is to decide on an IP address and assign one.
